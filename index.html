                        On the surface, the advent of widespread Internet access 
                        and the improved communication capabilities that accompany 
                        it would seem to have heralded a new age of increasingly 
                        informed citizens. &nbsp;With the wealth of human knowledge 
                        suddenly at the behest of your average citizen, one would 
                        think the fallacious claims could easily be countered with 
                        a matter of clicks.

                    <p>
                        However, this increased accessibility has opened the way 
                        for a new age of propaganda. &nbsp;As more people are 
                        able to post professional-appearing content, the trust 
                        the general public has in news outlets has been exploited 
                        to further the goals of those presenting themselves as 
                        journalists while distancing themselves from the code of 
                        conduct professional journalists adhere to.

                        principles relate to the moral implications of fake news.

        <!-- Cultural Relativism -->
        <section class="section section--cr" id="cr">
            <h2 class="section__heading">Cultural Relativism</h2>
            <div class="section__panel-container">
                <div class="section__panel section__panel--text">
                    <p>
                        A cultural relativist holds that when viewing the products 
                        of an individual (be it beliefs, values, or practices), 
                        that individual’s culture should be the lens through which 
                        those products are evaluated. &nbsp;This perspective should 
                        be applied to consuming news, as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While most cultures promote honesty, biased news is still 
                        present across all cultural groups.  This is important to 
                        consider as a common tactic to avoid fake news is to get 
                        your news from foreign sources. &nbsp;The idea behind this 
                        is that other countries will not have as much interest in 
                        political goals of your country’s domestic groups. &nbsp;
                        In many cases, this may hold true; however, in an increasingly 
                        connected world, one country’s citizens’ perception of another 
                        country may have implications on the original country’s 
                        political goals. &nbsp;This particularly holds true if the 
                        country being written about has a prominent role on the 
                        world’s stage, such as the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As such, it is important to consider where another culture’s 
                        (be it a different country or another culture within your own 
                        country) interest may lie when consuming news from that culture.

                        As the verse listed here show, many religions hold deception as 
                        a dishonorable trait, even if it serves to benefit the religious group.  
                        &nbsp;Misinformation, being generally spread with the intent of deceiving an 
                        audience for the benefit of whatever goal the creator is promoting, 
                        would be detested by religious groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That being said, studies suggest that religious people (along with 
                        members of any dogmatic group) are more likely to be susceptible to 
                        believing fake news (Bronstein, 2018). &nbsp;This conflict between that 
                        tendency and what many religious texts advocate for would suggest 
                        that a good citizen who is also religious may need to be extra 
                        skeptical when receiving their news.

                    <p>
                        Note: The study cited here had a relative small sample size at just
                        over 900 individuals, suggesting further research is needed to have
                        a confident connection between religiosity and susceptibility to fake
                        news.

            <h2 class="section__heading">Ethical Egoism</h2>
            <div class="section__panel-container">

                    <p>
                        Ethical egoism is the one ethical framework that would 
                        perhaps be able to view misinformation as a morally 
                        permissible act. &nbsp;An ethical egoist holds the position 
                        that one must do what is best for them, and in an age 
                        where anyone can post fake news in order to further their 
                        own interests, an ethical egoist would find that ability 
                        to be advantageous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, the self-interested nature of ethical 
                        egoism means a practitioner that is a consumer of fake news 
                        would find issue with another agent trying to further their 
                        ideals at the potential expense of their own. &nbsp;As a result, 
                        an ethical egoist falling on this side of the dynamic may 
                        be more likely to practice skepticism to ensure they do not 
                        fall victim to someone else. &nbsp;This is the silver lining that 
                        this framework provides in relation to misinformation.

                        Immanuel Kant held an “absolute prohibition against lying” 
                        (Carson, 2010), a maxim resulting from Kant’s categorical 
                        imperative. &nbsp;As such, someone operating from a Kantian 
                        perspective would view the dissemination of misinformation 
                        to always be wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Kantian consumer may be the one to speak out the loudest 
                        against misinformation on all sides due to their belief that 
                        there is no situation where that act is permissible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, most reputable new sources demand that their 
                        reporters and journalists strictly adhere to journalistic 
                        standards and ethics in order to strip the information they 
                        deliver from biases as much as possible. &nbsp;Kant would approve.

                        On the surface, the advent of widespread Internet access 
                        and the improved communication capabilities that accompany 
                        it would seem to have heralded a new age of increasingly 
                        informed citizens. &nbsp;With the wealth of human knowledge 
                        suddenly at the behest of your average citizen, one would 
                        think the fallacious claims could easily be countered with 
                        a matter of clicks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this increased accessibility has opened the way 
                        for a new age of propaganda. &nbsp;As more people are 
                        able to post professional-appearing content, the trust 
                        the general public has in news outlets has been exploited 
                        to further the goals of those presenting themselves as 
                        journalists while distancing themselves from the code of 
                        conduct professional journalists adhere to.

                        This presentation will take the issue of misinformation 
                        through various ethical frameworks, addressing how their 
                        principles relate to the moral implications of fake news.

        <!-- Cultural Relativism -->
        <section class="section section--cr" id="cr">
            <h2 class="section__heading">Cultural Relativism</h2>
            <div class="section__panel-container">
                <div class="section__panel section__panel--text">
                    <p>
                        A cultural relativist holds that when viewing the products 
                        of an individual (be it beliefs, values, or practices), 
                        that individual’s culture should be the lens through which 
                        those products are evaluated. &nbsp;This perspective should 
                        be applied to consuming news, as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While most cultures promote honesty, biased news is still 
                        present across all cultural groups.  This is important to 
                        consider as a common tactic to avoid fake news is to get 
                        your news from foreign sources. &nbsp;The idea behind this 
                        is that other countries will not have as much interest in 
                        political goals of your country’s domestic groups. &nbsp;
                        In many cases, this may hold true; however, in an increasingly 
                        connected world, one country’s citizens’ perception of another 
                        country may have implications on the original country’s 
                        political goals. &nbsp;This particularly holds true if the 
                        country being written about has a prominent role on the 
                        world’s stage, such as the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As such, it is important to consider where another culture’s 
                        (be it a different country or another culture within your own 
                        country) interest may lie when consuming news from that culture.

                        As the verse listed here show, many religions hold deception as 
                        a dishonorable trait, even if it serves to benefit the religious group.  
                        &nbsp;Misinformation, being generally spread with the intent of deceiving an 
                        audience for the benefit of whatever goal the creator is promoting, 
                        would be detested by religious groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That being said, studies suggest that religious people (along with 
                        members of any dogmatic group) are more likely to be susceptible to 
                        believing fake news (Bronstein, 2018). &nbsp;This conflict between that 
                        tendency and what many religious texts advocate for would suggest 
                        that a good citizen who is also religious may need to be extra 
                        skeptical when receiving their news.

                    <p>
                        Note: The study cited here had a relatively small sample size at just
                        over 900 individuals, suggesting further research is needed to form
                        a confident connection between religiosity and susceptibility to fake
                        news.

            <h2 class="section__heading">Ethical Egoism</h2>
            <div class="section__panel-container">

                    <p>
                        Ethical egoism is the one ethical framework that would 
                        perhaps be able to view misinformation as a morally 
                        permissible act. &nbsp;An ethical egoist holds the position 
                        that one must do what is best for them, and in an age 
                        where anyone can post fake news in order to further their 
                        own interests, an ethical egoist would find that ability 
                        to be advantageous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, the self-interested nature of ethical 
                        egoism means a practitioner that is a consumer of fake news 
                        would find issue with another agent trying to further their 
                        ideals at the potential expense of their own. &nbsp;As a result, 
                        an ethical egoist falling on this side of the dynamic may 
                        be more likely to practice skepticism to ensure they do not 
                        fall victim to someone else. &nbsp;This is the silver lining that 
                        this framework provides in relation to misinformation.

                        In societies that promote free speech and decry censorship, 
                        social contract theory is highly applicable. &nbsp;To maintain 
                        social order, we hold each other accountable for each other’s 
                        actions. &nbsp;This extends to journalistic integrity where we 
                        uphold the moral value of honesty.

                        We would not want to be deceived ourselves, and if we abide 
                        by social contract theory, we must also hold that we would 
                        not deceive others. &nbsp;Often, the social contract is 
                        realized through legislation. &nbsp;In recent years, we have 
                        seen many countries enact laws in order to curtail the spread 
                        of misinformation. &nbsp;For example,

                            masquerades as news.

                        The focus Utilitarians have on increasing the overall happiness 
                        of people, along with the view that the interest of all should 
                        be considered equal, lends itself to promoting journalistic integrity. 
                        &nbsp;Promoting the goals of a smaller group over the overall 
                        interests of the population is a definitively anti-utilitarian view. 
                        &nbsp;Utilitarians would stand up against misinformation as a matter 
                        of moral principle.

                    <p>
                    It’s worth noting that some act-based variations of utilitarianism
                    could be used to justify misinformation if the person believes that 
                    lying to achieve some goal would increase the overall happiness of
                     people – the ends justify the means. &nbsp;However, rule-based 
                     utilitarianism would find no way of justifying lying as honesty 
                     would undoubtedly be seen as the path that leads to the most 
                     happiness in the world.

                        Immanuel Kant held an “absolute prohibition against lying” 
                        (Carson, 2010), a maxim resulting from Kant’s categorical 
                        imperative. &nbsp;As such, someone operating from a Kantian 
                        perspective would view the dissemination of misinformation 
                        to always be wrong.

                    <p>
                        A Kantian consumer may be the one to speak out the loudest 
                        against misinformation on all sides due to their belief that 
                        there is no situation where that act is permissible.

                        In addition, most reputable new sources demand that their

                        standards and ethics in order to strip the information they 
                        deliver from biases as much as possible. &nbsp;Kant would approve.

                        Feminist ethics concerns itself primarily with extending 
                        ethics to include women in the conversation, but in a 
                        larger sense it addressed the role power structures play 
                        in our formation of morality. &nbsp;In many ways, this 
                        perspective is applicable to misinformation campaigns as 
                        they often seek to shift the power dynamics in favor of 
                        the group the author of the information is championing.

                    <p>
                        In addition, feminist ethics discusses how traditionally 
                        masculine traits, including autonomy, independence, and 
                        hierarchy dominate our moral discussions, where as 
                        traditionally feminine traits like connection, emotion, 
                        and trust are downplayed. &nbsp;It is not uncommon, even 
                        today, for misinformation to be spread that disparages 
                        these traditionally feminine traits and those that stand 
                        for them. &nbsp;Someone prescribing to feminist ethics 
                        would have a particular interest in fighting against 
                        misinformation as feminist, along with many marginalized 
                        groups that modern feminism also advocates for, are often 
                        the victim of fake news.

                    <p>
                        Note: this is of course not to say that a feminist is not
                        capable of spread misinformation themselves. &nbsp;We must
                        always be aware that fake news can come from any group.

                        An important aspect of the human condition is the constant, unwavering

                        &nbsp;A sound epistemology is an important utility in that pursuit
                        and for navigating our complex world. &nbsp;Information that 
                        comports with reality is useful information, because that 
                        is what allows us to make accurate decisions,

                        to mitigate this increasing issue, we must not only value 
                        critical thinking but also educate the public on how they 
                        can exercise that skill. &nbsp;Rigorous research is a
                        laborious task that many people will not naturally undertake 
                        for that reason. &nbsp;However, the alternative is to allow others to 
                        make those decisions for us, and we cannot guarantee in that 
                        case that our best interests and the best interests of our 
                        society are being upheld.

                        My role in dealing with this issue is two-fold. &nbsp;As a 
                        citizen, I feel I am obligated to question everything. &nbsp;
                        I cannot allow myself to fall into the bad habit of dishonestly
                         dismissing dissenting opinions and unquestioningly upholding 
                         those that validate my own perspective. &nbsp;This involves 
                         practicing the many subskills necessary for critical thinking, 
                         including checking multiple sources and looking for the signs 
                         of potential fake news, such as lack of references and clear 
                         authorship and looking into the research used to backup the 
                         article to check its validity (Kiely & Robertson, 2016). &nbsp;As a developer, I 
                         may find myself in a position where the code that I write can 
                         impart biases on the content my products deliver. &nbsp;Any 
                         algorithm I write or platforms I help create should be crafted 
                         in a way that prevents the spread of misinformation as best as 
                         possible.
